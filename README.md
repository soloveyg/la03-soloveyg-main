# README

## Introduction

In this project you will be working on linked lists to get used to working with pointers.

- Due: 1 Week
- Deliverables: Commit and push to Github. Post Github link to Brightspace.

## Preparations

If you have not done so, install gdb using the following command:

    sudo apt install gdb

## Level 1, 2, 3

TL;DR Fix anything that says TODO

There are three levels to this assignment. For details, look at the README.md file in each directory

- [Level1](level1/README.md)
- [Level2](level2/README.md)
- [Level3](level3/README.md)

There's also a directory called `unity`, which is used for unit testing. You may safely ignore this directory (as long
as you don't modify it).

## Submission

If you're using Github, just push your changes to the github repository, and post the link to the assignments page. I
will pick up any code that you've pushed by the deadline (make sure you **do** push to Github!).

## Grading Rubric

There are 6 sub-levels with equal weight each. Within each sublevel, you will be graded using the following criteria:

- 80% Specifications: The program should work and satisfy test cases
- 20% Readability: The program have clear flow and have clear documentation (including header file
documentation).
